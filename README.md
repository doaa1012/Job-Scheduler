# Job-Scheduler
This is a job scheduling environment for training agents through reinforcement learning algorithms like DQN.
Simulate a job scheduling environment without preemption and two job instance types with variable amount of resource instances, job numbers and max job time. This environment is created by extending the [openAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/docs/) class for compatibility.
